This is a *basic* kawaii bootloader wiper. It also has many uwus hehe. Make sure to set boot options to legacy BIOS, or not. Up to you hehe.
1. nasm -f bin -o bootloader.bin bootloader.asm (assemble via NASM or use the already .bin file).
2. Save the .bin file in the same directory as the .py or .exe loader if you compiled it. You're good to go uwu.
3. Use it on a virtual machine for testing purposes (QEMU, VirtualBox, etc.) I HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT TO TEST IT ON AN ACTUAL MACHINE •̀ω•́
